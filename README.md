I use a nodeMCU and a mpu6050 to measure accelerations and angles of the hand. The data is sent to the PC and received by a program written in processing. On the processing side Data is cleaned up in the case of accelerations. The data concerning the angles are used to calculate the intersection between the y axis of the mpu6050 and an imaginary plane placed at a distance that can be set by the sensitivity variable. The coordinates of the intersection are then translated from the initial system to a system that originates on the intersection plane, at which point the values ​​are restricted to the coordinates that can be represented by the PC screen. With the data obtained, I use the Robot class to simulate system inputs and move the cursor. The class using the drawDirection () method represents the position of the sensor in a 3D environment. With the "sample ()" method you can record data on text files.
